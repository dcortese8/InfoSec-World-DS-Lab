This can be altered by a user, but none of the current logs gave evidence an attacker did this. We used a binary variable to indicate userId < 1000 or userId   1000. Alternatively, one could use an ordinal mapping that buckets all userId < 1000 at zero and then increment upwards for each new user.

When manually analying the data, this was a critical field in conjunction with the eventName. For our baselines, we refrained from utilising this, although the model should be given an encoding of this using a hash or ability to learn a useful encoding on its own.
